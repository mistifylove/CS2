# CS2
Computer Science 2 (CS2) is all about learning the basics of programming and applying them to create simple but useful projects. In this subject, students explore how to write code, handle inputs and outputs, and design programs that solve real problems.

This is the repository of Misty Gean Moreno. AssignMate, you can add assignments, view them, and mark them as done, keeping everything neat and organized.

# Project Title
AssignMate

## Problem Statement
Many students forget assignments because they have no easy way to track them. AssignMate is a simple program that stores tasks with subjects and due dates so students can stay organized.

## Project Objectives
1. Let students add tasks with subjects and due dates.
2. Show all tasks and their status (Pending/Done).
3. Allow marking tasks as done.

## Planned Features
- Add task
- View all tasks
- Mark task as done
- Show updated task list

## Planned Inputs and Outputs
# Inputs
- Task title (e.g., "Science Project")
- Subject (e.g., "Science")
- Due date (e.g., "2025-08-20")
- Task number to mark as done (e.g., "2")
# Outputs
- Confirmation when a task is added (e.g., "Task added!")
- List of all tasks with details and status (Pending/Done)
- Confirmation when a task is marked as done (e.g., "Task marked as done!")
- Updated list of tasks after changes

# Logic Plan
Start  
Ask for task title, subject, due date  
Save as Pending  
Repeat for more tasks  
Show all tasks  
Ask which one is done  
Change status to Done  
Show updated list  
End
