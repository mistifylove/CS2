# CS2
Computer Science 2 (CS2) is all about learning the basics of programming and applying them to create simple but useful projects. In this subject, students explore how to write code, handle inputs and outputs, and design programs that solve real problems.
This is the repository of Misty Gean Moreno, Katarah Sabrina Abarca, and Adriann Gabriell Arpilleda. AssignMate lets you add assignments, view them, and mark them as done, keeping everything neat and organized.

# Project Title
AssignMate

## Problem Statement
Many students forget assignments because they have no easy way to track them. AssignMate is a simple program that stores tasks with subjects and due dates so students can stay organized.

## Project Objectives
1. Let students add tasks with subjects and due dates.
2. Show all tasks and their status (Pending/Done).
3. Allow marking tasks as done.
   
## Planned Features
- Add task
- View all tasks
- Mark task as done
- Show updated task list
  
## Planned Inputs and Outputs
# Inputs:
- Task title (e.g., "Science Project")
- Subject (e.g., "Science")
- Due date (e.g., "2025-08-20")
- Task number to mark as done (e.g., "2")
# Outputs:
- Confirmation when a task is added (e.g., "Task added!")
- List of all tasks with details and status (Pending/Done)
- Confirmation when a task is marked as done (e.g., "Task marked as done!")
- Updated list of tasks after changes

# Logic Plan
Start
Ask for task title, subject, due date
Save as Pending
Repeat for more tasks
Show all tasks
Ask which one is done
Change status to Done
Show updated list
End

## Target Users
- Students who need an easy and organized way to track assignments.
- Users need to quickly add, view, and mark tasks as done.

# Why the Project is Worth Solving
Many students forget or overlook assignments without a simple tracking system. AssignMate helps students stay organized, manage their deadlines, and reduce stress, improving productivity and academic performance.

## Updated Features
- Add task with title, subject, and due date
- View all tasks with their status (Pending/Done)
- Mark tasks as done
- Show updated task list immediately
- Simple interface for ease-of-use

## Improved Logic Flow
1. Input task title, subject, and due date
2. Save task as Pending
3. Allow multiple tasks to be added in one session
4. Display all tasks with status
5. Prompt user to mark tasks as Done
6. Update task status and show updated list
7. Repeat until user exits
8. End program
